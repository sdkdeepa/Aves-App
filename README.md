# Udacity Cloud Developer Capstone Project

I developed a image uploading app for birds called "AVES APP". This app caters for bird lovers who can upload beautiful images of birds. The techology used behind in devloping this app is as follows:

- AWS
   
   - Lambdas for storing functions
   - DynamoDB
   - Api Gateway (front-door securing, monitoring...the REST API)
   - S3 Bucket (storage of images)
   - CloudFormation (infrastructure as code, provisioning a collection of needed resources)
   - IAM user
   
- Serverless Framework

- Frontend client
   - ReactJS
   
- Auth0
   - for 3rd party OAuth integration 
   - RS256 Algorithm

- Optimisations
   - Global Secondary Indexes on DynamoDB
   - X-ray to analyze and debug production, distributed applications
